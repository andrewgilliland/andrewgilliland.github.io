          Hi👋, I'm Andrew. I'm a mobile developer living Bloomington, Illinois.
          I am passionate about constantly learning and using new mobile and web
          technologies. I currently work mainly with React Native and Swift to
          build mobile applications, but always enjoy implementing new
          technologies. In my spare time, I enjoy learning about fitness and
          nutrition, woodworking and a music aficionado.
